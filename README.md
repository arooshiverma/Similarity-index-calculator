# Similarity-index-calculator
Checks similarity index between 2 documents for the purpose of plagiarism detection. Algorithm based on graph theory.\
The two input documents are named : doc1.txt and doc2.txt\
![Algorithm](https://github.com/arooshiverma/Similarity-index-calculator/blob/main/imgs/img1.JPG?raw=true)

Similarity score between 2 documents, given the optimal matching: 

𝒙=(Σ𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠[𝐢][𝐣])/𝟎.𝟓(𝐥𝟏+𝐥𝟐)

Where l1 and l2 are the number of sentences in document 1 and document 2 respectively. Matching is the 2-d matrix showing the optimal matching and the edge weights.
