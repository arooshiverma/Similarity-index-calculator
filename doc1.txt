Most of us have sisters in our family. 
Some of us have an elder sister, and some of us have a younger. 
Maybe your sister is not the funniest, the greatest, or not the perfect, but she is the one whom you can blindly trust.
She is the one who can easily make you laugh. 
She is the one who can effortlessly make me feel great. 
She is always there for me, suggesting and supporting me. 
She is one of the best advisors I have got in my life.
